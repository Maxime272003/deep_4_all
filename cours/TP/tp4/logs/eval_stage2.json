      "correct": true,
      "response": "<reasoning>\nThe passage says August needed money because he was afraid he’d be kicked out of his house. Being evicted usually means he must pay the rent or mortgage to stay.

The fish market, pet shop, and intertidal zone are places or environments, not entities that can be excited. “Obesity” is a condition, not a person. The only plausible answer is a fishmonger, who sells fish and seafood and would likely be interested in crabs as a product. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is C.\n</reasoning>\n\nFinal Answer: C"
