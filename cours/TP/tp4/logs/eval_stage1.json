This matches both conditions.  \n**Telephone booth** – may have a phone, but not a phone book, and it can be in a building that has an elevator.  \n**House** – many houses have elevators (elevators in houses are rare), and a phone book is not a usual feature.\n\nThus, the best answer is **library**.\n</reasoning>\n\n**Final Answer: C**"
